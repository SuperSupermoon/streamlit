    "Findings": "",
    "Impression": "Cardiomegaly is moderate and unchanged. Mediastinal silhouette is unchanged including mild mediastinal widening potentially reflecting known mediastinal lipomatosis. Left lung opacities are slightly more conspicuous as compared to the previous study and are concerning for infectious process. There is mild vascular enlargement but no overt pulmonary edema. Followup of the patient after antibiotic therapy is recommended for documentation of resolution.",
