    "Impression": "AP chest compared to through. There is still a large right pleural fluid collection, now with a smaller component of air, at the base of the right lung which is severely restricted by severe pleural thickening which has worsened along the costal and particularly along the right mediastinal pleural surface. It would be helpful in our evaluation to know whether the nature of the right pleural effusion was infectious, malignant, are otherwise inflammatory. Left lung is well inflated and clear. Heart is not enlarged. Vascular clips denote prior surgery at the level of the gastroesophageal junction.",
