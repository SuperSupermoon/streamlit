    "History": "-year-old woman with respiratory failure secondary to congestive cardiac failure and acute appendicitis, now with new gastric tube placement, evaluate interval change.",
    "Findings": "Right IJ line tip projects over the expected region of the upper SVC. Right-sided PICC tip projects over the expected region of the cavoatrial junction. ET tube is approximately 43 cm above the carina. A feeding tube is noted with tip in the expected region of the proximal gastric antrum with side ports within the body of the stomach. Severe cardiomegaly is again noted. Right-sided pleural effusion is unchanged from the prior examination. The opacification at the left lung base is unchanged from the most recent prior examination may represent pleural effusion with atelectasis, however infectious process such as pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.",
