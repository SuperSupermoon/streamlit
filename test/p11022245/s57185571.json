    "History": "Evaluation for pleural effusions.",
    "Findings": "As compared to the previous radiograph, the right-sided pleural effusion has minimally decreased. On the left, however, the effusion has substantially increased and leads to a near total opacification of the left hemithorax. Subsequently, severe atelectatic changes are present. The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed, the right internal jugular vein catheter has also been removed, a nasogastric tube, the endotracheal tube and a venous introduction sheath remains in situ.",
