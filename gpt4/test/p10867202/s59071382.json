    "sequence": 1,
    "History": "Leukocytosis.",
    "Findings": "In the background of severe interstitial lung disease, which is predominantly reflected in fine reticulation of the lung periphery on each side, there are patchy superimposed opacities in the right upper lung as well as the left mid and lower lung worrisome for superimposed pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The lung volume are again low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged, allowing for differences in technique.",
    "Impression": "Multifocal opacities worrisome for pneumonia superimposed on severe underlying interstitial lung disease although recent prior radiographs are not available for comparison and progression of chronic lung disease could be considered as an alternative, acute superimposed pneumonia seems most likely.",
